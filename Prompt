ðŸŽ¨ Prompt: Designer Slider with Interactive UI & Smooth Animations
Build a modern, elegant Designer Slider component for showcasing creative works such as portfolios, fashion collections, UI/UX designs, or branding visuals. The slider should feature a clean and minimal interface, enriched with smooth transition animations, hover interactions, and toggle controls for layout or theme switching (e.g., grid/slider view, dark/light mode).

The component should support:

Image & Video Slides (with titles, short descriptions, and CTA buttons)

Autoplay with pause-on-hover

Manual navigation controls (arrows, swipe/drag, keyboard nav)

Slide counter indicator

Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Framer Motion or GSAP-based animations for slide-in/out, zoom effects, fade transitions

Hover effects like parallax tilt, glow, or overlay blur

Theme toggle button (light/dark mode with smooth animation)

Optional: Vertical scroll mode or 3D cube-style slider

It should allow:

Customizable slide content (designers can change image, title, link, etc.)

Dynamic data loading (from JSON or API)

Support for galleries with filtering (e.g., UX, Branding, 3D, Illustrations)

Download / Preview options for each slide if needed

Keyboard-accessibility & screen-reader friendly design
